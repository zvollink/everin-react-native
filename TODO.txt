NEXT STEPS
[_] Keep fields from auto-completing (eg. typing 'hmars.' converts to 'games.').
[_] Sketch storyboard of what the general app screen flow should look like before going much further.

TODO
[_] Need better email and password validation in sign up flow.
[_] Build out Forgot Password option.

BUGS
[_] Back button shifts up along with rest of view out of sight
    as keyboard comes into view (signup and login).

NICE TO HAVES
[_] Auto-focus first input on sign up and login screens.
      ** Note: I've already attempted this and it causes an issue with the
         code that moves he view up as they keyboard enters the screen.
         
IDEAS FOR THE APP
[_] A place where you can keep track of cool places you've visited.
[_] You should be able to add pictures, journal about it, add location, tag
    friends, and share with people.
[_] Perhaps there's a "news feed" that only shows your friends latest posts.
[_] News feed could eventually show nearby EverIn's.
[_] Ability to add and have friends.
